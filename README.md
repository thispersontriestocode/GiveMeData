# GiveMeData
A program made to open a csv file or a folder containing multiple csv files then to pull certain columns/data and then resave the columns we want as a new csv file in the location we choose. 
When you run the program a pop up window will open asking whether you want a single file or a folder. You then choose your file and let it do the rest. Within the program you can edit which columns 
you may want in a new dataframe that will become a new csv. You will also get a pop up window that will ask where you want to save the files to on your pc.
